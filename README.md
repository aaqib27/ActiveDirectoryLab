<h1>Active Directory Administration and Automation Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

###
This project involves creating an Active Directory and network administration environment using PowerShell automation, remote access server (RAS) configuration, and Windows server management. Configuring and running this environment will enhance your understanding of Active Directory and Windows networking. PowerShell scripts can be developed and implemented to automate the provisioning, maintenance, and de-provisioning of user accounts within Active Directory, streamlining account management processes. We configure RAS features to support Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT), enhancing remote access capabilities for secure network connections. Additionally, Windows DNS and DHCP services are managed to ensure robust and autonomous network address management, and Windows File Servers are configured with quotas and NTFS permissions to maintain secure and organized file storage.

###
This project demonstrates critical network administration tasks and automation techniques, providing valuable hands-on experience in managing Active Directory and Windows networking environments.
